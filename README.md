# Cuff Less Blood Pressure Estimation Dataset

1. What is the purpose of the research?
1.1 Introduction:
Hypertension is a major health problem worldwide and is a major risk factor for many cardiovascular diseases. Accurate and regular measurement of blood pressure is critical for early detection and management of hypertension. The traditional method of cuffed blood pressure measurement can be perceived by users as uncomfortable and limiting. Therefore, cuffless blood pressure estimation is being investigated as a more comfortable and user-friendly alternative. The Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation Dataset is a dataset created to contribute to the research in this area. I will explain the steps taken on this dataset through code analysis and modeling, and I will compare these data with graphical outputs simultaneously by working on the code myself.
1.2 Creating a Dataset:
The Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation Dataset is the product of a large-scale study and contains data collected from various sources. The dataset contains real-time data from a variety of participants, including many different characteristics. These features include electrocardiography (ECG) data, pulse wave data, acceleration data and respiration data. Each participant has a reference tag that contains this data collected during the cuffed blood pressure measurement.
1.3 Research Objective:
The Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation Dataset was created to form the basis for various research in the field of cuffless blood pressure estimation. This dataset encourages the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for estimating blood pressure. Using this dataset, researchers can test different algorithms, develop new methods and improve existing methods. They can also use this dataset to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of sensors used in cuffless blood pressure estimation.
The code part is to analyze the dataset of blood pressure measurements. In this analysis, photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, a sensor that measures oxygen levels in the blood, and electrocardiography (ECG) signals are used.
1.4 Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation Dataset is a major contribution to research on cuffless blood pressure estimation. By providing a platform for the development and evaluation of various algorithms, this dataset inspires work towards developing a more user-friendly and convenient method for early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Furthermore, the dataset serves as an essential reference source for the development of sensor technologies and improving their accuracy. The findings from the use of this dataset can contribute to the development of more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.


2. How many observations does the dataset consist of? What is the number of rows and columns?
In this area, let's first examine the properties of the dataset we examined through the code:
- The dataset contains 1000 observations. 
- For each observation, 3 signals were recorded: PPG, ECG and blood pressure (BP). 
- Each signal consists of 125 samples. 
- Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) values were recorded separately.
This code means that the sequence of rows contains 1 row and 1000 columns.
While obtaining these steps, I tested this process with Spyder IDE on Anaconda, which we used in the course. I share these additional images with you:

this is the way it is.
